# Survival-Analysis

The dataset is from the National Cancer Institute’s Director’s Challenge Lung Study. This data consists of lung cancer data from individuals drawn from 4 different cancer centers. The adjuvant chemo is our covariate of interest. Here, I performed Kaplan Mieir plots, log rank test, and used Cox Proportional hazard Model. R markdown was used for this project.
